# JohnLemon's House of Horrors

Welcome to the "JohnLemon's House of Horrors" repository, an exhilarating chase-based game where you must navigate a haunted house, feeding the monster to keep it at bay, and outsmarting its minions. Will you escape the House of Horrors unscathed?

## Game Concept

In this game, you take on the role of JohnLemon, trapped in a spooky house and pursued by a relentless monster. Your objective is to collect food items scattered throughout the house to feed the monster, temporarily sending it into a slumber. But beware, each food item consumed by the monster makes it faster, intensifying the challenge.

### Gameplay Features

- **Player and Monster:** Play as JohnLemon, pursued by a terrifying monster throughout the game.

- **Feeding the Monster:** Collect and drop food items to divert the monster's path and induce its sleep. Keep feeding to stay safe.

- **Monster Speed:** Each food item consumed makes the monster faster, increasing the game's intensity.

- **Sound Cues:** Listen for the monster's growls and footsteps to gauge its proximity and make strategic decisions.

- **Minions:** When the monster hasn't been fed or hasn't found you for a while, it deploys minions. They chase you and alert the monster when they spot food. Beware, as they can attack if you get too close.
